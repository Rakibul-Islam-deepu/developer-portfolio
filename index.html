            <h3>intro of a human being</h3>
            <p>n interest in human nature can take many forms, and the questions in which it finds expression can range
                from such matters as the character of human motivation to the prospects for human happiness.
                Philosophers have asked questions like these, but they have been more interested in what differentiates
                human beings from other living things and generally from the natural world in which they live. The
                answer they have most often given to such questions is that the distinctive features of human nature
                have to do with the mental functioning of human beings â€“ more specifically, with their intellectual and
                moral powers.</p>
            <p>i am a normal human being who faces many problems and has lot of responsibilities <strong>this is the
                    time to stand up</strong>.And do the thing to be more succesfull in my life.</p>
